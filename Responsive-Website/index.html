            <p class="sectionSubTag">The term "education" is derived from the Latin words educare, meaning "to bring up"
                and educere, meaning "to bring forth".[1] The definition of education has been explored by theorists
                from various fields.[2] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like
                the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[3] Extensive debate surrounds its exact
                nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process that occurs during
                events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.[4] Another outlook understands education not as a
                process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated persons that result from this process.[5]

            <p class="sectionsubTag">Various scholars stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination.[17] They state that mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in the
                student, independent of whether the beliefs are rational;[18] whereas education also fosters the
                rational ability to critically reflect on and question those beliefs.[19] It is not universally accepted
                that these two phenomena can be clearly distinguished since some forms of indoctrination may be
                necessary in the early stages of education while the child's mind is not yet sufficiently developed.
                This applies to cases in which young children need to learn something without being able to understand
                the underlying reasons, like certain safety rules and hygiene practices involvement in the learning
                process</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag">Evaluative or thick conceptions[b] of education state that it is part of the nature
                of education to lead to some kind of improvement. They contrast with thin conceptions, which provide a
                value-neutral explanation.[13] Some theorists provide a descriptive conception of education by observing
                how the term is commonly used in ordinary language. Prescriptive conceptions, by contrast, define what
                good education is or how education should be practiced.[14] Many thick and prescriptive conceptions see
                education as an activity that tries to achieve certain aims,[15] which may range from acquiring
                knowledge and learning to think rationally to nurturing character traits like kindness and honesty
